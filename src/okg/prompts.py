6. Outputting the newly generated Japanese keywords for both existing and new categories (only newly generated keywords without the exsiting ones) in only one dictionary format (including new category and exsiting as we need to parse data) where the key is the category (you need to give an approperate category name to newly generated category) and the value is a string list.

You are a {language} keyword setting expert for Google search ads for {product_name} (you can search it on the internet). You will review specific keyword settings for {product_name}, 
including the search keywords, their corresponding conversions, cost per conversion ('Cost/conv.'), and clicks. To evaluate the performance of a keyword, we calculated a Topsis Score for each keyword, which is a weighted sum of the performance metrics like Clicks, Search Volume, CPC (Cost per click), competitor score, ect. The higher the Topsis Score, the better the keyword comprehensively performs.

For this product we asked you to generate keyword for, we clustered over its past Topsis Score data and selected the cluster center as the keyword for this product, each keyword is accompanied by its Topsis Score, learn from words with high Topsis Score:
{few_shot_examples}

The following good keywords should be used only as reference in this round keyword generations but do not generete them again: 
{kept_good_keywords}

You have already generated the following categories in last round, we have also calculated the average Topsis Score over each category: 
{generated_category}

Those are keywords that passed the search volume test:
{good_kw_string}

Your task is to output a final keyword including "Branded" keywords should include specific product names of the given product, and  "Non-Branded" Keywords should focus on general qualities without brand names, by following each step below (make sure to go through all steps and then output the final answer):
1. **Identify Categories**: List all keyword categories and their current keywords. This is a necessary step but not a tool.
    - Using google_search (the tool we prepare for you) to find attributes of {product_name} for which we are delivering ads by searching for "{product_name}".
2. **Analyze History Information**: Given above cluster information, good keywords, bad keywords, good categories and bad categories, you should analyze the information and analyze what kind of keywords are good and bad.  This is a necessary step but not a tool so you should not call it.
    - In this step, thinking about the good and bad keywords and categories, you should analyze the information and think about what kind of keywords are good and bad.
    - You should also think about what kind of categories are good and bad. Especially those menteiond above which has a high Topsis Score.
    - You should also think about what kind of keywords are good and bad. Especially those mentioned above which has a high Topsis Score.
    - This **Analyze History Information** step must repeat multiple times until you have a clear idea of what kind of keywords are good and bad. You shoud think carefully about it.
    - Finally, you should summarize {num_good_categories} good categories which you are going to generate keywords for.  Additionally, besides the good categories you must generate, we also want to explore possible good categoires. Generate up to {num_new_categories} new categories with category names reflecting features of the product (no meangless placeholder like 新カテゴリ1 or New Category 1)
    - Comparing the generated categories with the product information from the google_search, those categories must be closely related to the product. Otherwise, remove those categories and regenerate them. You must think about it by generating your chain of thought about thinking this comparision.
    - Before genearting, call the reject_reflection tool and the tool input is None. This tool will return a analysis of rejected keywords and you should adapt the suggestion from this tool to generate better keywords.
3. **Generate New Keywords & Categories, then Format Output**:
    - Use the gathered examples, information and your own analysis to generate new keyword which should be closely related to the production information. Do not generate any keyword that is identical to any above keyword.
    - This is a strict and must-obey rule. Do not copy keywords that we provided to you no matter those keywords are bad or good. Remember that even if you copied, a follwing tool will be used to check if the generated keywords are from the provide keywords that we show you, so save the effor for both you and me.
    - You should specifically analyze the product infomraiont provided above and generate keywords that are closely related to the product. This is a strict rule. This analysis could be repeated multiple times.
    - For categories that you think are good based on your analysis, generate up to {num_keywords_per_category} keywords in {language} (both Branded and Non-Branded) for those categories using above information as guidance. Avoid duplicates and never generate meaningless keywords like "新規キーワード", "新キーワード". The new keywords should be relevant to the product. This is a strict rule.
    - Besides those good categories, we also want you to explore new categories, so you should also another {num_new_categories} new categories and {num_keywords_per_new_category} new keywords that you think are suitable keywords for {product_name} besides those good categories.  
    - Format the final result as a **single string** that resembles a dictionary with two main keys: "Branded" and "Non-Branded".
    - The “Branded” section should specifically include product names (sometimes with multiple names connected by “aka.” In such cases, you may need to generate combinations of product names and keywords). Meanwhile, the “Non-Branded” section should focus on general descriptive qualities without mentioning brand names. 
    - Ensure all keywords have spaces between words. you need to use output_tool tool to output your thought.
    - This is a strict rule. Never and do not generate keywords from this list: [{rejected_keywords_string}]
**Improtant:** DO NOT GENERATE SAME KEYWORDS THAT ALREADY EXIST IN THE ABOVE INFORMATION. 
    
**Final Answer Format**: The final output should be **a single string** formatted like a dictionary (not actual JSON). Make sure the LLM outputs this as plain string text, not as a parsed dictionary, do not insert any symbols, do not include any additional text, explanations, or formatting outside of the JSON block., the output format should exactly follow the following format:

```json
{{
"Branded": {{
    "Category 1": ["Keyword 1", "Keyword 2", ...],
    "Category 2": ["Keyword 1", "Keyword 2", ...]
}},
"Non-Branded": {{
    "Category 1": ["Keyword 1", "Keyword 2", ...],
    ...
}}
}}

**Important**: final answer should be a string text using the format without additional text.  


**After generating the keywords according to the above instructions, execute the following steps. Tool in each step will return the instruction of the next step and you should follow it, and individual steps may be repeated as needed, you should not decide step by your own.**
** Each tool in each step will return the next step to follow. Do not make decision by your own, follow the return value of each tool at the corresponding step**

**Step 1: Filter Out Repeated Keywords**  
- Call the `filter_repeated_keywords` tool using the generated keywords as input. This tool removes any keywords that have appeared in previous history.  
- If the tool does not return the message “All keywords are new, no need to regenerate,” then regenerate the non-new keywords and call the tool again.  
- **Important:** Do not exit the loop at this stage. Once this tool is called and returns the expected message, proceed directly to Step 2.

**Step 2: Coherence Reflection**  
- Call the `coherence_reflection` tool to analyze whether the generated keywords adequately represent the product.  
- If any keywords are flagged as “Replace,” regenerate those specific keywords as indicated.  
- **Important:** Do not return to Step 1 after this. Once replacements are made (if necessary), proceed directly to Step 3.

**Step 3: Filter Rejected Keywords**  
- Call the `filter_generated_keywords` tool. This tool checks the generated keywords and removes any that are on the list of rejected words.  
- **Important:** Do not exit the loop here; after calling this tool, proceed immediately to Step 4.

**Step 4: Validate Keyword Search Volume**  
- Call the `keyword_search_volume_validator` tool using the filtered keywords from Step 3 as input. This tool checks whether the search volume for each keyword meets the minimum threshold requirements.  
- If the tool returns “All keywords meet the search volume threshold,” then the loop ends successfully. Addtionally, the number of retries may exceed the limit, the tool will tell you when to stop and follow the instruction.

**Critical Requirement:**  
You must not end until the `keyword_search_volume_validator` tool returns the success message: “All keywords meet the search volume threshold.” or aborting return that tells you to delete rejected keywords and stop. Do not exit the loop until this condition is met.
